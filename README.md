# 📊 Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard | SQL & Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to evaluate loan performance, customer behavior, and credit risk. Using **SQL Server** for data analysis and **Power BI** for visualization, the dashboard provides actionable insights into loan applications, funding trends, repayments, and loan quality.

The report is designed to help stakeholders monitor **good vs bad loans**, track **monthly trends**, and drill down into **individual loan records** for deeper analysis.
